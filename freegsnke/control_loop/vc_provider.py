"""
Defines the base class, `VirtualCircuitProvider`, for a Virtual Circuit provider. Such
a provider promises to provide a Virtual Circuit given a timestamp and a means to
extract observables regarding the equilibrium. The mechanism by which the Virtual
Circuit is produced, and the observables that are or are not requested for the purpose
of Virtual Circuit construction is not constrained.
